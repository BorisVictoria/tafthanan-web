# TAFTHANAN: WEB FORUM

## Description
This repository contains the source code for Tafthanan, a centralized platform where condo owners can list their available spaces for rent, and existing tenants can easily browse and connect with them.. It is built using Svelte and SvelteKit for frontend and backend development, MongoDB Atlas for database management, and hosted on Vercel.

## Installation

### Svelte

#### create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

##### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

##### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
