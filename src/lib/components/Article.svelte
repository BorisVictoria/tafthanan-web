    let content = "Hi! I'm an incoming engineering college freshman and during my jhs and shs days, I always consumed coffee. Especially during hell weeks or if may big event that day. Most of my coffees are usually those cheap P30 Lucky day from 7/11 or food panda orders. I don't have a particularly favorite shop I order from since it usually depends what I'm feeling, my budget, and if I think I need a bit more caffeine kick. This summer I've been experimenting and kind of trying to find coffee that works well with what I need and I've come to the conclusion that I really like iced Americano, Caramel Macchiato, and ordinary lattes. I'll be going to an expensive university and I don't want to spend a lot of money on just coffee, maybe the occasional monthly treats but definitely not a regular. I want to know if you guys have any coffee recommendations for students. I plan to make coffee at home then pack them in a different water bottle and take it to school. My family highly discourages those 2-in-1 coffee packets so maybe any recommendations that are a bit more on the healthier side but still affordable for students hehe.";
